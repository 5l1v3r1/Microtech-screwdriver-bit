Screwdriver bit for unscrewing a proprietary screw developed by Microtech (i believe)
I don't know a lot about who produce the screw, it looks like a “snake eyes” type, but with one more pin.

This type of screws can be found mainly on 'vigik' intercoms.

In France it's a commonly used screwhead to avoid tampering, and due to the difficulty to find the screwdriver bit i did this 3D model.

The hex is 10mm and pins are 1.45mm
